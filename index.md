Hi! My name is Dan and I write about embedded machine learning. I'm coauthor of the book [TinyML (O'Reilly)](https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Learning-TensorFlow-Ultra-Low-Power-Microcontrollers/dp/1492052043). I work at [Edge Impulse](http://edgeimpulse.com/) as Founding TinyML Engineer. Previously, I worked on the TensorFlow team at Google and co-founded [Tiny Farms](https://www.tiny-farms.com/), the insect farming company.
