Hey! My name is Dan and I write about edge AI and embedded machine learning.

I'm Head of Machine Learning at [Edge Impulse](http://edgeimpulse.com/) and coauthor of the books [AI at the Edge](https://www.amazon.com/AI-Edge-Real-World-Problems-Embedded/dp/1098120205) and [TinyML: Machine Learning with TensorFlow Lite on Arduino and Ultra-Low-Power Microcontrollers](https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Learning-TensorFlow-Ultra-Low-Power-Microcontrollers/dp/1492052043).

I previously worked on the [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) team as part of [Google AI](https://ai.google/), and co-founded [Tiny Farms](https://www.tiny-farms.com/), the insect farming company.
