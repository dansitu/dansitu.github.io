# About

Hey! My name is Dan and I write about embedded machine learning.

I work as the Founding TinyML Engineer at [Edge Impulse](http://edgeimpulse.com/). I'm coauthor of the O'Reilly book [TinyML: Machine Learning with TensorFlow Lite on Arduino and Ultra-Low-Power Microcontrollers](https://www.amazon.com/TinyML-Learning-TensorFlow-Ultra-Low-Power-Microcontrollers/dp/1492052043), along with [Pete Warden](http://petewarden.com/), and I help organize the [tinyML meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-ultra-low-Power-ML-at-the-Edge).

I've previously worked on the [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) team as part of [Google AI](https://ai.google/), and co-founded [Tiny Farms](https://www.tiny-farms.com/), the insect farming company.
